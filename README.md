## Introduction to the Project

This project is a simple demonstration of the Soccer Football Project.
It gives the basic understanding of how the unity is going to work out. There is just a simple prototype of the user playing the game.
This is made on unity version 2021.3.5f1.
## Project Workflow

The project first runs on the menu scene
- There is a play button and exit button.
- When the user hit the play button it plays the game and loads the scene. 
- When the user hit the exit button it quits the game.
- The soccerfield consists of the cube.
- The player slightly drops down on the ground. The ball is also at the random location. 
- Player can spot the ball and when the player reaches near the ball. The ball just sticks to the player. 
- The player then can move the ball into the direction of the goal post and hit it by using a mouse click. For the controls the keyboard control is for direction and the mouse control is for the camera direction. 
- Then the player can shoot the ball and when it passes through the goal detector a score is updated in the score field located in top right of the scene. 
- The similar goes for for the opponent area if the player goes and scores in the next goalpost then the scoreboard increses. 
- A goal text effect is made when the user scores the goal. 
- After the goal the ball drops down at the random position again and the player can go to score the ball again.
